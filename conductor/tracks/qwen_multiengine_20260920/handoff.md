# Handoff: qwen_multiengine_20260920

Status when this note was written: Phases 1–4 complete (Phases 3 and 4 user manual
verification approved 2026-09-21), Phase 5 implementation complete (Tasks 5.1–5.4; the Phase 5
manual checkpoint is the next user-gated step), Phase 0 partial (Task 0.3 needs release
hardware). All commits are **local on `main`** — nothing has been pushed (AGENTS.md Git Policy).

## Gate (always run before committing)

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check . && .venv/bin/ruff format --check .
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Baseline: everything passes except
`tests/unit/test_stream_playback.py::TestRealQtSmoke::test_real_qaudiosink_offscreen_smoke`
(device-less host; documented, not a regression). Latest full run: 1624 passed,
1 deselected (that smoke).

Environment note: the real-QtMultimedia smoke cases (`TestRealPlayerSmoke`,
`TestRealProbeSmoke`, `TestRealQtSmoke`) are fragile under `-n auto` in a
device-less sandbox — one run hung inside a `QFFmpeg` demuxer thread under pytest's
fd capture (the GOTCHA already documented in `test_playback.py`). They finish in
under a second when run serially (`-n 0`); if a full run ever stalls, re-run those
three alone and deselect them to get the rest of the signal.

## Next: the Phase 5 manual-verification checkpoint (user-gated)

Phase 5 has no implementable task left: Task 5.4 (Studio provenance, `24561d5`) is done, so the
Conductor checkpoint bead `nqx.7.5` ("Integrate profiles across controllers, caches, and Studio",
depends on 5.1–5.4) is what remains. Ask the user to run it: with the app running, open a text
artifact in Studio, confirm each clip's provenance (profile label + language) matches the engine
that produced the audio, try "Tạo lại" on a clip whose audio came from another profile and confirm
the app refuses with the required profile and offers the switch (never a silent re-synthesis),
perform the switch and confirm the same clip now re-synthesizes, then confirm gain/trim/preview and
Studio export still work while a foreign profile is active. Close `nqx.7.5` only on explicit
approval, then start Phase 6 (Task 6.1 first; 6.2 and 6.3 run concurrently after it, and 6.3 owns
the Studio/Cloning QML that surfaces these provenance/matching-profile actions — Task 5.4
deliberately touched no QML).

What Task 5.4 added (build on it, do not re-litigate):

- `synthesis_context.same_engine(stored, requested)` — the engine-only rule for an EXPLICIT
  re-synthesis: same `profile` wins; `stored is None` (audio predating provenance) means VieNeu.
  Caches keep using the stricter `context_matches`.
- `StudioClip.context` (default `None` = unknown/legacy), stamped by `load_project_from_artifact(
  path, text, context=)` and `load_project_from_chapters(..., contexts=state.contexts)`, and
  replaced by `splice_clip_audio(..., context=)` when new audio lands.
- `controller.studioClips` rows now carry `profile`, `profileLabel` and `language` ("" when the
  audio predates provenance) — Phase 6's QML binds these.
- `studioRegenClip` refuses a mismatch with the required profile in `errorText` and arms
  `studioRegenProfile` / `studioRegenProfileLabel` (signal `studioRegenProfileChanged`);
  `studioSwitchToRegenProfile()` performs the switch and consumes the offer.
- The armed splice is disarmed on all three non-success paths (not admitted, cancelled, failed) —
  including `_studio_regen_context`, so a later synthesis can never be spliced into a clip that did
  not ask for it.
- `_current_artifact_context` is the identity of the committed foreground artifact; Studio reads it
  in `openInStudio`, so provenance always names the engine that actually produced the audio.

What Tasks 5.2/5.3 gave Task 5.4 (the seams it builds on):

- `controller.submission_context_for(voice, *, report=True) -> SynthesisContext | None` is the ONE
  gate: it builds the context through `context_for(...)`, which validates
  profile/language/speaker/clone against the capability table, and on refusal sets `errorText` from
  the capability table's own message and returns `None` (nothing is queued, no engine starts, no
  listener registers). Every submission path now carries the frozen context on its `TTSRequest`.
  `report=False` is the read-only probe a cache/Studio comparison uses — it never touches
  `errorText`.
- `core/synthesis_context.py` owns the shared comparison helpers Task 5.4 should reuse:
  `context_from_payload(payload)` (fail-soft inverse of `fingerprint_payload`), `context_matches(
  stored, requested)` (the conservative truth table) and `legacy_render_compatible(requested)`
  (a render with no recorded identity is reusable for VieNeu only — every pre-multi-engine render
  was VieNeu's).
- `controller.synthesisLanguage` (the RESOLVED code: `""` for VieNeu, `auto` for Qwen when unset)
  and `controller.setSynthesisLanguage(code) -> bool` (validates against the active profile,
  persists `Settings.synthesis_language`, refuses with a Vietnamese `tr()` message listing the
  supported codes). Switching profiles drops a code the incoming profile cannot serve.
- `submit_stream_for_listener(text, voice, listener, *, kind=..., context=None)` — callers may pass
  a persisted snapshot; omitting it builds and validates one at submission time.
- `BatchItem.context` + one `runAll` snapshot (`_snapshot_context(voice)`) and the `profile`/
  `language` keys on `batchController.items`; the Paragraph run refuses before touching the queue.
- The Qwen owner assembly: `_build_qwen_engine()` (verified install locations only, actionable
  refusals) + `_providers_for()` (one-provider `EngineProviders`, `None` = VieNeu single-engine
  default), with the injectable `qwen_engine_factory` seam for tests.
- The audiobook's provenance pattern is the reference for Studio clips: a payload map in the
  workspace state, identity re-reconciled on load against the requested context, replacement as one
  locked transaction that drops the sidecars describing the replaced audio, and a render
  snapshotted at submission (never re-derived at terminal time).

## Still blocked (needs the user's machines)

- Task 0.3 real-device probes — the six commands live in
  `packaging/qwen-runtime-requirements.json` (`platforms[].evidence.probeCommand`).
- The Conductor "User Manual Verification" checkpoints for Phases 0–2 (`nqx.2.4`,
  `nqx.3.3`, `nqx.4.4`) — Phase 3's (`nqx.5.5`) and Phase 4's (`nqx.6.3`) were approved
  2026-09-21 and are closed.

## Housekeeping

- `bd` epic `VieNeuTTSApp-nqx`; Phase 3 tasks are `.5.x` (all closed, including the manual
  checkpoint), Phase 4 tasks are `.6.x` (all closed, including the manual checkpoint `.6.3`),
  Phase 5 tasks are `.7.x` (`.7.1`–`.7.4` closed; `.7.5` is the Phase 5 manual checkpoint, open
  and waiting on the user). Note: `bd ready` does not list a task whose parent phase bead is still open
  (parent-child blocks) — that is the established pattern, so do not close a phase bead early.
  `conductor/tracks/qwen_multiengine_20260920/metadata.json` carries the corrected
  phase→beads mapping.
